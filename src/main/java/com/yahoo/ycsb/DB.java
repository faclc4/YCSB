/**
 * A layer for accessing a database to be benchmarked. Each thread in the client
 * will be given its own instance of whatever DB class is to be used in the test.
 * This class should be constructed using a no-argument constructor, so we can
 * load it dynamically. Any argument-based initialization should be
 * done by init().
 * 
 * Note that YCSB does not make any use of the return codes returned by this class.
 * Instead, it keeps a count of the return values and presents them to the user.
 * 
 * The semantics of methods such as insert, update and delete vary from database
 * to database.  In particular, operations may or may not be durable once these
 * methods commit, and some systems may return 'success' regardless of whether
 * or not a tuple with a matching key existed before the call.  Rather than dictate
 * the exact semantics of these methods, we recommend you either implement them
 * to match the database's default semantics, or the semantics of your 
 * target application.  For the sake of comparison between experiments we also 
 * recommend you explain the semantics you chose when presenting performance results.
